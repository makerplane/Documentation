Documentation for MakerPlane Projects.

This is where we keep major documentation for tools and projects for MakerPlane systems that are in Github.

Current documents:

**1. MakerPlane CAN-FIX Avionics Tools**
   
   Provides a reference for developers that wish to create plug-ins or applications that use the MakerPlane tools and communication protocol. This document has three main sections:

   FiX Gateway;
   PyAvTools; and
   CANArduino.
   
 **2. pyEfis Overview and Implementation Guide**
 
    Contains detailed instructions on how to install from scratch and how to configure the screens.
